/* 8. Shapes
Define function: printShape(shape, height, character)
shape is a String and is either "Square", "Triangle", "Diamond".
height is a Number and is the height of the shape. Assume the number is odd.
character is a String that represents the contents of the shape. Assume this String contains just one character.
Use a switch statement to determine which shape was passed in.
Use the console.log function to print the desired shape.
Example for printShape("Square", 3, "%");

Example for printShape("Triangle", 3, "$");

Example for printShape("Diamond", 5, "*");
